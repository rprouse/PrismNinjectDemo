# Ninject for Prism for Xamarin.Forms Demo

Demo project for my blog post on using [Ninject with Prism for Xamarin Forms](http://www.alteridem.net/2016/01/03/using-ninject-for-prism-for-xamarin-forms/).

This is the default project created by the [Prism Template Pack](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e7b6bde2-ba59-43dd-9d14-58409940ffa0) converted to used Ninject instead of Unity as the IoC container.
